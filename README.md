EntityUtils
========================

Sheep and Villagers were harmed in making of this plugin.

## Features
Each of those features can be turned on and off in the configuration file.

* **Conveyer Belts:** Any powered repeater will push items along the path. If there is a snow block below the repeater, then the entities will move 3x faster.
* **Piston Flingers:** Any entity that is in front of an extending piston will get flinged.
* **Chest Eaters:** Any items that land on top of a chest will get sucked in.
* **Ladder Transport:** Any entity that is on a ladder will get pushed up. If that is the last ladder on the line, it will teleport the entity on top of the block that the ladder is attached to.
* **Stair Cannons:** If there is a powered repeater followed by wooden stairs, it will shoot the entity like from a cannon.
* **Teleporters:** If there is a repeater followed by an Iron(5), Redstone(10), Gold(15), Lapis(20) or Diamond(25) will get teleported the amount of blocks in brackets.
* **Redstone Power:** If there is an item that is eaten by a chest, transported by a repeater or pushed by ladder, will power any redstone wires around it.
